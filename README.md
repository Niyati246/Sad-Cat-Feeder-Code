# About the Sad Cat Feeder
This project was made as a part of my Computer Engineering course in grade 12 at Mayfield Secondary School! This project is called the "Sad Cat Project", which addresses issues faced by cats. I decided to create an automatic cat-food dispenser which will ensure that the cat does not stay hungry. 

## Supplies Used
- Cardboard
- RTC (Real Time Clock)
- 180 degree servo
- Tape and hot glue
- Waterbottle (as food holder)
- Beads (as food)
